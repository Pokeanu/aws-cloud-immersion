# AWS Cloud Immersion

This workshop focuses on teaching people new to Aamazon Web Services (AWS) of how to get started with the basic services required to deploy a real world application.

# Preconditions

You must have an AWS account. Currently the resources used for this workshop will be within the free tier.

If you are still paranoid and want to ensure your not going over the free tier, you can [set up a billing alarm](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-alarms.html) , just in case.
